# Excel-Data-Cleaning-Project

## 📄 Project Overview
In this project, I used **Microsoft Excel** to clean a raw dataset and prepare it for analysis.  
The main goal was to remove errors, blanks, and duplicates to make the data consistent and ready for further insights.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. **Find and Replace Values**  
   - Used the `Ctrl + F` (Find & Replace) function to correct or remove unwanted values.

2. **Handling Blank Cells**  
   - Used the **Go To Special → Blanks** feature to identify and remove empty cells.

3. **Removing Duplicates**  
   - Applied the **Remove Duplicates** feature from the Data tab to eliminate duplicate rows.

4. **Conditional Formatting**  
   - Highlighted specific data patterns and errors using Excel’s Conditional Formatting tool.

5. **Final Data Verification**  
   - Checked the dataset to ensure all columns were properly cleaned and formatted.
